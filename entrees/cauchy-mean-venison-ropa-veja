Ingredients

-3 lb venison (tough cuts like shoulder or butt) trimmed and cut into large chunks
-2 links fresh chorizo sausage (optional - but recommended since vension is so lean)
-1 red onion, coarsely chopped
-2 red bell peppers, coarsely chopped
-3 cloves garlic, sliced
-vegetable oil
-1 can chopped tomatoes
-about 3 chipotle peppers (in adobo), chopped up
-2 tsp smoked paprika
-1 tsp chili powder
-1 tsp ground corriander
-hot sauce and/or cayenne (depending on the spice level you want)
-2-4 cups beef broth
-salt to taste

Note: all measurements are really just suggestions.  Adujust to taste.

Heat oil in a large heavy pot (I used a cast iron dutch oven). Brown the venison on all sides, working in batches, and transferring browned meat to a large bowl (add more oil as needed). If there are a lot of brown bits stuck to the bottom of the pan, you can deglaze with a little broth and pour it into the bowl. Break the chorizo up into chunks & brown, then transfer to the bowl with the venison. Next brown the onion, peppers, and garlic (add oil if needed).  Put the meat & any juices back into the pot, and add tomatoes and spices.  Add enough broth to almost cover the venison.  Cover and simmer over low heat for about 2-3 hours, until you can pull the venison apart.  (After about an hour of simmering, taste the liquid and adjust spices & salt). Stir every once in a while, and add more broth if too much liquid has evaporated.
Take out the venison and shred the meat. Put it back in the liquid, turn up the heat a bit and simmer, stirring more frequently, until most of the liquid has been cooked off (It should be wet, but not soupy). 
This is good as filling for tacos or over rice & beans.
